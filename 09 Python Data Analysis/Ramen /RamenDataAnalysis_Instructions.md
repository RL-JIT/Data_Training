# Ramen Ratings Data Analysis

## Introduction

### Data Source

This analysis explores a dataset of ramen ratings from various brands, countries, and styles. The data was collected from **The Ramen Rater**, a well-known source for ramen reviews. The dataset contains information about the brand, style, country of origin, and rating for each ramen product reviewed.  This dataset can be downloaded from the following url, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/residentmario/ramen-ratings.

### Why This Data is of Interest

Ramen is a staple food in many countries, and it's ubiquitious nature has led to the creation of a wide variety of styles and flavors. Understanding consumer preferences, how different brands and countries fare in terms of ratings, and whether certain styles are consistently rated higher can be valuable insights for both consumers and producers.

### Questions and Hypotheses

In this analysis, we aim to answer the following questions to carry out both descriptive and diagnostic analysis:

1. **Which country produces the highest-rated ramen?**
   - Hypothesis: Japanese ramen brands generally receive higher ratings than brands from other countries.
   
2. **Does the style of ramen (e.g., cup, bowl, pack) affect its rating?**
   - Hypothesis: Ramen served in cups or bowls might have different average ratings compared to those in packs.
   
3. **Is there a correlation between the style of ramen and the country of origin?**
   - Hypothesis: Certain countries might prefer specific styles of ramen, and this could be reflected in the dataset.
   
4. **How do different brands compare in terms of their average ratings?**
   - Hypothesis: A few brands dominate the high ratings, indicating consistent quality.

## Steps for Data Analysis

### 1. Import Required Libraries

First, we need to import the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

### 2. Load the Dataset

Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. Ensure that the data is correctly loaded and check for any initial inconsistencies.

```python
df = pd.read_csv('/mnt/data/Top Ramen Ratings.csv')
df.head()
```

### 3. Data Cleaning

#### a. Handling Missing Values

Check for any missing values in the dataset. Missing values can distort the analysis, so we should decide on an appropriate method to handle them, such as removing or imputing them.

```python
df.isnull().sum()
```

- If there are missing values in the rating column, decide whether to drop those rows or fill them with the average rating.

```python
df.dropna(subset=['Stars'], inplace=True)
# or
# df['Stars'].fillna(df['Stars'].mean(), inplace=True)
```

#### b. Data Type Conversion

Ensure that the 'Stars' column is correctly recognized as a numerical data type, as it might be read as a string.

```python
df['Stars'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Stars'], errors='coerce')
df.dtypes
```

#### c. Removing Invalid Data

Check for and remove any invalid data entries, such as ratings that do not make sense (e.g., negative values, extremely high values).

```python
df = df[(df['Stars'] >= 0) & (df['Stars'] <= 5)]
```

### 4. Data Transformation

#### a. Normalize Country Names

Sometimes country names might appear in different forms (e.g., 'USA' and 'United States'). Normalize country names for consistency.

```python
df['Country'] = df['Country'].replace({
    'USA': 'United States',
    'UK': 'United Kingdom',
    # Add more replacements as necessary
})
```

#### b. Grouping and Aggregation

To answer our questions, we might need to group data by certain columns and calculate the mean ratings.

```python
country_avg = df.groupby('Country')['Stars'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
style_avg = df.groupby('Style')['Stars'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
brand_avg = df.groupby('Brand')['Stars'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
```

### 5. Data Visualization

#### a. Bar Plot of Average Ratings by Country

Visualize the average ramen ratings by country using a bar plot.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.barplot(x=country_avg.index, y=country_avg.values)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.title('Average Ramen Ratings by Country')
plt.ylabel('Average Rating')
plt.xlabel('Country')
plt.show()
```

#### b. Box Plot of Ratings by Style

Examine how ratings vary by ramen style with a box plot.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
sns.boxplot(x='Style', y='Stars', data=df)
plt.title('Distribution of Ramen Ratings by Style')
plt.ylabel('Rating')
plt.xlabel('Style')
plt.show()
```

#### c. Correlation Matrix and Heatmap

To explore the relationship between different variables, create a correlation matrix followed by a heatmap.

```python
# Encode categorical variables if necessary
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(df[['Country', 'Style', 'Stars']], drop_first=True)

# Create a correlation matrix
corr_matrix = df_encoded.corr()

# Plot the heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt='.2f')
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

### 6. Hypothesis Testing

Using the visualizations and summaries, we can start testing our hypotheses.

- **Country Ratings**: Based on the bar plot, identify if Japanese brands indeed have higher average ratings.
- **Style Ratings**: Analyze the box plot to see if there are any significant differences in ratings by style.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Use the heatmap to identify any significant correlations between variables, such as between country and style.

### 7. Conclusion

Conclude the analysis by summarizing the key findings:

- **Country of Origin**: Which country has the highest-rated ramen? Was the hypothesis correct?
- **Style Impact**: Does the style significantly affect the rating? Any surprises?
- **Brand Dominance**: Did a few brands dominate the high ratings? 
- **Correlations**: What were the notable correlations found in the heatmap?

Finally, discuss how this analysis could be extended in the future:

- **Future Directions**: Consider exploring other factors such as price, availability, or even consumer reviews if available. Additionally, sentiment analysis on reviews could provide deeper insights into consumer preferences.

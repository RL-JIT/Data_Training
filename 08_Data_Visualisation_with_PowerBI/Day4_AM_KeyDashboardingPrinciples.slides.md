# Key Dashboarding Principles

### Notes: 
In addition to choosing the right visualisations for your data, there are a number of design principles that we should keep in mind when creating reports in Power BI or dashboards in Tableau to ensure that reports are effectively doing their job of communicating key insights about our data and, by way of their interactivity, allowing users to generate their own insights from data.

## Double Up on White Space

- White space is the area around the visualisations, including the margins and inside of report. 
- Ensure there is plenty of white space around each visualization
- White space helps to reduce clutter and makes the dashboard more readable.
- Avoid cramming too many visuals in a single view.

### Notes:

Borders and padding also counts as vvhite space.

"In this viz, Olushola uses white space and shading to create a visual distinction between the charts and the supporting text. Notice how the borders are equally weighted around each element and have been kept intentionally blank for maximum impact."

Cole Knaflic’s Storytelling with Data book provides some basic guidelines for preserving white space:

Keep margins free of text and visuals
Resist the urge to stretch visuals to take up the available space
Consider how you can use white space strategically for emphasis. For instance, if there is one thing that is really important, consider making that the only thing on the page.

## Focus on the Data

- The focus should be on the data, not on the design elements.
- Busy backgrounds can distract from the data; keep backgrounds minimal and clean.
- Use design elements to highlight key trends and insights; enhance the data without distracting from it.

## Uniform Visualizations

- Keep the width and height (and font, colour scheme, and formatting) of similar visualizations uniform.
- This helps in maintaining consistency (so the dimensions are not distracting from the data).
- Aligned and cohesive visuals creates a cleaner look and a more aesthetically pleasing report.

### Notes:
"In this business dashboard, Priya has applied padding around each chart and KPI card. Combined with shading, this helps to create a subtle visual distinction between each element, giving each section room to breathe. Notice how Priya created space between the bars in the bar charts to help provide visual clarity, too." https://sarahlovesdata.co.uk/2023/07/31/iron-quest-white-space/#:~:text=In%20data%20visualisation%2C%20white%20space,data%20or%20other%20design%20elements.

## Titles and Labels

- Each page of the report should have a clear and descriptive title.
- Use appropriate labels for each visualization to make it clear what the data represents.
- Avoid using overly technical jargon.

## Accessible Themes

- Use accessible themes to ensure your dashboard is readable by everyone, including those with color blindness.
- If using custom colors, make sure they are complementary by using a color wheel tool like Adobe Color.

## Cohesive Pages

- Each page of the report should be cohesive and focused around a particular topic like revenue data or product data.
- Avoid mixing unrelated data on the same page to prevent confusion.
- Provide context for the data to help users understand the story being told.

## Minimalism

- Only include labels and data that are crucial.
- Avoid repetitious or extraneous information or visualizations.
- Do not clutter the pages; less is often more.

### Notes:
"In this viz, Samo used a grey background and a shadow to frame the viz and give it a floating-like effect. This adds visual impact, helping to draw the audience’s attention to the viz itself."
---

## Interactivity

- Reports should allow users to generate their own insights.
- Make visualizations interactive (e.g., use filters, slicers, and drill-throughs).
- Interactive elements engage users and provide a deeper understanding of the data.

## Group Discussion
Look at each of these 3 dashboards. Discuss what works and what does not about these designs.

### Notes:
Put learners in groups to discuss these designs, their positives and negatives.  Give them 15min or 5min per design. Save the insights provided in notes about these designs for group discussion after.

### Design 1
![](./assets/Dashboard_exemplars/BadDashboards/London.webp)

### Notes: 
"This London City dashboard attempts to present far too much information in a small space and has ended up looking extremely cluttered and distracting.
There are too many distracting colours, many of which serve no real purpose and this draw focus away from the data itself.
There are also far too many different types of data visualization on the dashboard with no clear linkage between them."

|||

### Design 2
![](./assets/Dashboard_exemplars/BadDashboards/College.jpg)

### Notes:
"The main problem with this dashboard from Dundas is that the same colour scheme is used for both the pie charts at the top and the bar charts at the bottom.
On first glance the user therefore assumes that there is some kind of link between the two and associates the coloured sections of the pie charts with the respective coloured bars below. In fact the two sets of information are not the same and therefore the colour scheme used only complicates things further.
A further fault is the use of 3D effects on the pie charts at the top. In an attempt to make the charts look more visually appealing, the creator has actually made it more difficult for the user to read and interpret."

### Design 3
![](./assets/Dashboard_exemplars/BadDashboards/TIB.webp)

### Notes: 
"The fill effects that have been used on the pie chart in the top left hand corner are completely unnecessary and make it difficult to interpret the size of each slice.
More worrying however, is the Fact that there is a legend to the right of it as well as a number of data labels underneath. This makes it extremely difficult to interpret what information the chart is actually displaying, especially at a glance."

### Reconvene: What works about each Dashboard? What doesn't?

### Notes: 
Return to each visual and let groups tell you what worked and what didn't and offer any insights (see slides) not covered already by groups.

## Application

- Now let's apply these principles to our reports (e.g. Bookshop data report) from previous sessions to make them portfolio ready, as professional and effective as possible with enhanced readability and user experience.

### Notes:
Show unformatted and formatted Customers/Products/Orders Report with Revenue and Product pages. Encourage learners to apply these principles to two or more projects during this session, which we have previously worked on, e.g. bookshop and titanic data.

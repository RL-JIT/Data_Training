## 1. The 5 Vs of Data

### Volume
- **Volume** is about how much data we create every day.
- Think of all your social media posts, online purchases, and sensor readings.

### Velocity
- **Velocity** is the speed at which data is made and processed.
- Real-time data, like live social media updates, is a good example.

### Variety
- **Variety** means the different types of data.
- This includes text, images, videos, and more.

### Veracity
- **Veracity** is about the quality and trustworthiness of the data.
- Clean, accurate data is crucial for good decisions.

### Value
- **Value** is the benefit we get from the data.
- Data is valuable when it helps us make better decisions.

### Check for Understanding
- **Question:** What are the 5 Vs of data?
- **Answer:** Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, Value.

## 4. Importance of Data Cleaning

### Why Clean Data?
- **Dirty data** leads to wrong conclusions.
- Clean data means accurate insights and better decisions.

### Common Issues
- **Typos and Spelling Errors:** Make data inconsistent.
- **Missing Values:** Affect calculations.
- **Duplicate Entries:** Skew results.
- **Outdated Information:** Reduces relevance.

### Key Steps
1. **Remove Duplicates:** Get rid of repeated data.
2. **Handle Missing Data:** Fill in or remove missing values.
3. **Correct Inaccuracies:** Fix errors and check against known data.
4. **Standardize Formats:** Use consistent formats for dates, text, etc.
5. **Filter Outliers:** Remove extreme values that don’t make sense.
6. **Check Data Types:** Ensure data is in the correct format (text, number, date).
7. **Validate Data:** Confirm accuracy and consistency.
8. **Shape & Transform Data:** Adjust data to make it more useful.

### Check for Understanding
- **Question:** Why is data cleaning important?
- **Answer:** To ensure accurate insights and better decisions.
